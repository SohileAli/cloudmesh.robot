# Robot Camp Day 1 Notes

## Introduction to camp.

### Purpose of camp:

* Create a robot swarm.
* Teach the importance of building a robot one at a time.

### Questions:

* How many people have programmed before?:

12

* How many people haven't programmed before?:

2

* Different programming languages used:

construct, scratch, tinker, python minstorm, hopscotch, robocell, vex robotics, minecraft

### Safety:

* In case of tornado, go to bathroom.
* If you see tornado, come inside and into the bathroom.
* In case of fire, students let instructor know, who will file them out in an orderly fashion after ringing the fire alarm.
* Fire drill will happen at some point in the camp.
* Supervision by team is required for saudering.
* Supervision by team is required for hot glue gun/ superglue.
* Crossing the wrong cable kills the robot.
* No carrying people around.

### Options to choose from

* Crimson bots:
use python, advanced.

* AirSwimmers:
use fins for movement, left, right, up and down.

* Plotter:
draws out images with a pen, day to build, half day to adjust.

## Crimson Bots.


### Robot recycling example:

* Robots are dumb.
* Programming bugs don't allow robot to behave the way you want it to.
* Be specific with your instructions.
* You have to know the instructions that need to be given to the robot.

### ESP8266:

* Board.
* Don't bend pins.
* Don't lick (poisonous).
* Only put wheels and motors on first.
* Battery power wires face the ESP.
* Build is different from the blueprint.
* Don't wire through the middle hole.

* Battery wiring: red wire goes to VIN, and black wire goes to GND.
* Flat side of battery always goes to the spring of the battery pack.

* ESP wiring: black = A-, red = A+, red = B-, black = B+.

* Small screwdrivers strip screws, use green ones.

### Terminal:

* Bottom right of screen.
* Black window with `>_` icon.
* `cms` command opens a graphic that says "cloudmesh".
* `cms robot welcome` displays a graphic of R2D2 and C3PO.
* `cms robot probe` displays the MAC address and TTY of the robots.
* `cms robot help` displays a help menu  
* `cms robot image fetch` fetches the image to be flashed on ESP8266.
* `cms robot flash erase` erases the preexisting image on ESP8266.
* `cms robot flash python` flashes python on to the ESP8266.
* `cms robot login` logs into picocom.
* `cd github` enters gitub directory in terminal from `~home`
* `cd cloudmesh.robot` enters cloudmesh.robot from the github directory.
* `git pull` does a github pull into a local directory.
* `cd ESP8266` enters the ESP8266 directory from cloudmesh.robot.
* `ls` lists items in a directory from terminal.
* `cms robot credentials set` allows network credentials to be set on an ESP8266.
* credentials will not be set on the ESP8266 if you're logged into picocom in another window.
* `cms robot put cred` assigns preset credentials to ESP8266.

### Robot GUI.

* IP addresses are used as the URL for the HTML GUI for the car robots.
* Buttons displayed move the robot in the direction assigned to each button.
