## AquaEmacs Installation

**Aquamacs** is an **emac editor** for Mac devices which allows the
user **to edit** text, HTML, LaTeX, C++, Java, Python, R, Perl, Ruby,
PHP, and more. In order to run Aquamacs, you have to go to
[Aquamacs](http://aquamacs.org/download.shtml) and click on the
topmost link, which should be the newest version of the program. If
the order changes, look for a link title Aquamacs Emacs X.XX (Right
now the version is 3.3). A download should start. Once it's finished
finished installing, you should go to the *Downloads* folder in
Finder, and open the installed file. You are now ready to use
Aquamacs.

##Emacs Tutorial

Starting out with Aquamacs, you should first set the default font. You
can open and close the Fonts window with the command ⌘⇧T. Pick a font
of your liking and close the Fonts window. The menus provide you with
the basic commands you will be using, and most menus are in spots
typical to most OSX programs.

There is some terminology in Aquamacs that can be confusing. For example:

* A **buffer** is the view of a document.
* **Frames** are windows which may contain more than one **tab**, each
  of which will have a different **buffer** similar to a web browser.
* A **directory** is a folder while **search** is essentially the "find" OSX feature.

You will mostly be using the File, Edit, Options, and Windows menus.

There is a toolbar at the top of each frame of Emacs. This toolbar
consists of icons representing basic file and editing commands. Items
can be added and removed from the toolbar. You can do this by
selecting or deselecting them in the Options> View> Toolbar Items
menu.

Emac also has keyboard shortcuts, most of which are combinations with
the Control or Meta keys.

The minibuffer is Emac's little window that appears at the bottom of a
frame when you type a command. You also type the text you want to find
and replace into the minibuffer. If you accidentally end up in the
minibuffer, you can press Ctrl+g to get out without issue.

While the Ctrl key is the Mac's control key, the Meta key is the esc
key. Therefore, anywhere that you need the Meta key to execute a
command, you should use the esc key.

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**

* File>Undo will cancel any command that you did not want done.
* `Ctrl-x` will cancel any command you are in the middle of.
* You can break paragraph lines with `Ctrl-x W`, where `W` will wrap text around word boundaries.
* To change case, position the cursor at the end of the current word, and press M-u for uppercase, M-l for lower case, and M-c for initial capital.

* To delete text to the end of the current word, press M-d.
* To delete text to the start of the current word, press M-Del. (Del is the normal Delete key)
* to delete the whole line from the position of the cursor to the end, press C-k.

* Transpose two adjacent characters with C-t (for "transpose").
* Transpose two adjacent words with M-t.
* Transpose two adjacent lines with C-x C-t.

* To sort lines in alphabetical order, select them and then press M-x.
