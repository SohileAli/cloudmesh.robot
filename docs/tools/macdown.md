## Markdown Tutorial

MarkDown is a text editing software which allows simple ways to format
text. MarkDown has most of the simple formatting options available in
Word or HTML documents. Here the formatting effects included in
MarkDown:

* If you need to emphasize text, you can wrap it in asterisks.
  Different number of asterisks produce different results:

Text in between two single asterisks becomes *italic*

Text in between two double asterisks becomes **bold**

And text in between two tripple asterisks becomes ***bold-italic***

* In order to hyperlink text, you can wrap them in brackets, and then
  put the link in parenthesis after the bracketed text.

Example:

	[Bracketed Text]+(link)

Type this without the plus sign and you will have a hyperlink.

* Formatting images have the same format as links, preceded by a `!`.

Example: 

	![Bracketed Text]+(link)

Type this without the plus signs and you will have an image and the
bracketed text is now the alt text.

* In order to make lists, you have to:

Make sure each item is preceded by a "*", a "-", or a "+"

This will give you a bulletpoint list.

If you need to indent items underneath already bulleted items, precede
the indent items with four spaces and they will be nested under the
item above them.

For numbered lists, just use numbers instead of bullets, but the
format remains the same.

* To qoute text:

Precede it with a ">".

Example >"Quote" =

	>Quote

Other syntax options can be found in the Format drop-down at the top
of the screen between View and Plug-ins.

Lastly, in order to start a new line of text, you need to press return
twice, instead of once like in word.
