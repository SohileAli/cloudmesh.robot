## Homebrew

**Homebrew** is a **package manager** for OS X which lets the
user **install software** from **UNIX** and **open source software**
that is not included in OSX.

In order to install Homebrew, open the Terminal app, and type in the
command

	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

and press the return key.

Allow a few moments for Homebrew to install. Now you have access to
Homebrew.
