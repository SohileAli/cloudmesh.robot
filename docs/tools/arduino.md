## Arduino

In the event that there is a TTY error, you will need to install
Arduino, since your Mac may be missing some drivers that are included
in Arduino. Simply go to
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/macOSX) and click on
the *download page* link under *Download the Arduino Software (IDE)*.
You should be brought to a page with installation options for
different OS. Click on *Mac OS X Lion or Newer* and you should be
brought to a contribution page. You don't have to pay for Arduino, so
if you do not want to contribute, click on *Just Download* and a zip
file should be downloaded. Go to your downloads, uncompress the file,
and Arduino should be in the new directory that is created. Do the one
time setup, and you are finished.
