## Terminal

On OSX, navigate to your **Applications Folder** in **Finder** and
open **Utilities**. In utilities, you will find the **Terminal**
application. Open it and you will be presented with a white text box.
You now know how to navigate to Terminal.

**Terminal** gives you an interface to OS X's bash shell, allowing you
to run programs on your OSX device. In order to run **programs** on
OSX, after typing each **command**, you need to press the **return**
button on your keyboard, in order to make terminal **execute** the
command.
