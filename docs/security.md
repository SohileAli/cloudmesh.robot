We experience an average of more than 20 tornadoes a year in Indiana, and the best way to protect yourself should one strike your location is to be prepared. Knowing the difference between a watch and warning can help you determine the risks you may face.

### Things you should do

* When you find out there is a tornado warning for your location, get inside a building, get away from exterior walls, and go down as far as you can.
* If you are in a car and a tornado is near, get out of your car and get inside a building, or lie in a ditch and protect your head with your hands.
* Instructors will get a weather radio and ensure it has full batteries in it.
* Instructors will take the weather radio with them to where you seek shelter so you can learn when a tornado warning expires.

### Donot do these

* Never wait for a siren to be sure if the danger is real; always head for shelter as soon as you get an alert from the National Weather Service or IU-Notify.
* Don’t rely on just IU-Notify for weather warnings. If you don’t have a weather radio, get an app for phone with tornado alerts.
* Don’t leave your shelter until an all clear has been given.
* Never seek shelter under a bridge; the bridge will act as a funnel and strengthen the winds underneath.

## Fire

Evacuate if

* A fire alarm is sounding
* There is the presence of fire, smoke, or the odor of burning in the building
* If you discover a fire, explosion or smoke in a building, inform your instructor that will activate the nearest fire alarm and proceed to evacuate, following the evacuation procedures here. 

## Drills

* Showcase the students the location where to meet in a case of a Tornado.
* Showcase the students how to leave the building in case of a fire. Showcase where to meet. Be prepared for a headcount. Identify if one of your classmates is missing.


## Scissors, Knifes and other Sharp tools

You are not allowed to use scissors, knifes, or other sharp tools including screwdrivers without supervision. Such tools must not be used inappropriately. Failure to use them appropriately may result in expulsion from the camp.

## Robot Floor

Robots are run on white boards in the middle of the room. You are not allowed to walk without reason across these boards as they need to be kept clean for the robots. If you need to pick up a robot please make sure to have clean shoes. If you do leave marks on the board we may ask you to clean them up yourself. 

## Robot Table Frames

Before running robots on the table you will get a table frame so that the robots is prevented to fall off the table.  

## Robot Tripods

A number of tripods are placed in the room. The tripods have a positioning sensor mounted on them and moving or touching the tripots will effect the sensors. The tripods are not to be touched. Failure may result in expulsion from the camp.

## Drone Nets

In case drones will be used in the camp, drones must not be flown in the open areas. Instead they will be positioned behind a net. In case you experiment with drones on your desk, they must be secured with a fishing line and you must wear safety goggles. These nets are not climbing nets. They should also not be used to hang on them. They present a safety barrier between you and the area where the drones fly. Other than opening the dedicated entry points to the flying area the nets must not be touched. Failure to do so may result in expulsion from the lab.

## Recreational Recess Activities

As part of the camp, instructors may decide to do some recreational outdoor activities. As part of this camp participants are required to follow instructions from instructors and to avoid dangerous activities. Same recess rules as in your school applies.
