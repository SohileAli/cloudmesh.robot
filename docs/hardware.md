# Hardware for IoT Example Projects

Fun with Hardware

* Learn how to program in python
* Allows you to keep your current computer unchanged
* Introduction to IOT devices
* We use two platforms esp8266 and Rspberry PI 3
* Evaluate choces bellow as you may find cheaper or better alternatives if you buy kits when they are available.
* Note that ordering from overseas suplieres may take significant time.
* Prices given here are done to provide estimate, they may vary

## Pi

* 4 * AA Rechargable Batteries & charger

Optionally you may want to get additional sensors such as wheel Encoders

* [Wheel Encoder](https://www.amazon.com/Wheel-Encoder-Kit-Robot-Car/dp/B00NPWGEIM/ref=sr_1_4?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1499254488&sr=1-4&keywords=speed+sensor+robot+car+wheel)

## Sensor Kit

It is fun to attach sensors to your IoT board. There are many kits ab]vailable and we encourage you to do comparisions. One such kit is

* $29.99 [Elegoo 37 Sensors](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-Upgraded-Modules-Tutorial-Arduino/dp/B01MG49ZQ5/ref=sr_1_7?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499251441&sr=1-7&keywords=elegoo)

However it does not include a breadboard like other kits. Hence we recommend that you get a breadboard as it makes experimenting easier.
 
* $5.68 [small bread board and wires](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-Premium-Female-tie-points-breadboard/dp/B06XB8TZVC/ref=sr_1_23?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499251600&sr=1-23&keywords=elegoo)

## Fish Kit


* $29.99 [shark](https://www.amazon.com/Swimmer-Inflatable-Flying-Replacement-Balloon/dp/B00658LN3E/ref=pd_bxgy_21_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00658LN3E&pd_rd_r=F71N2YCYE6Z0BCCEPQJC&pd_rd_w=AwYab&pd_rd_wg=rHTnv&psc=1&refRID=F71N2YCYE6Z0BCCEPQJC)
	* cheaper ballones leak
	* before assembly and putting gas in make sure components work. 
	* gas will last typically for one week
	* $39.99 gas can be purchased in party store 
* 2 g9 servo
* soldering (for cable, so cheap one will do)
* pins
* esp
* double sided scotch tape
* hot glue gun
* paper clips

## Alternative components


### Esp8266 Alternatives

Two models are good. Adafruit has some added features, but may need soldering

* $8.79 [NodeMCU](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Version-NodeMCU-Internet-Development/dp/B010O1G1ES/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499251149&sr=1-3&keywords=esp8266)
* $16.95 [Adafruit Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821)

### Car Parts Alternatives

* $14.59 [Car Chasis](https://www.amazon.com/Ardokit-Chassis-Encoder-Battery-Arduino/dp/B00K5OWHXO/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499251712&sr=1-3&keywords=robot+car)
* $22.88 [Car Chasis and Arduino](https://www.amazon.com/VKmaker-Avoidance-tracking-Chassis-Ultrasonic/dp/B01CXVA6IO/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499251770&sr=1-6&keywords=robot+car)
